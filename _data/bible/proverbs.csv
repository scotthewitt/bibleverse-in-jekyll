20001001,20,1,1,"The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:"
20001002,20,1,2,To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;
20001003,20,1,3,"To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness, justice, and equity;"
20001004,20,1,4,"To give prudence to the simple, Knowledge and discretion to the young man:"
20001005,20,1,5,"That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; That the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:"
20001006,20,1,6,"To understand a proverb, and parables, The words and riddles of the wise."
20001007,20,1,7,The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
20001008,20,1,8,"My son, listen to your father's instruction, And don't forsake your mother's teaching:"
20001009,20,1,9,"For they will be a garland to grace your head, And chains around your neck."
20001010,20,1,10,"My son, if sinners entice you, don't consent."
20001011,20,1,11,"If they say, ""Come with us, Let's lay in wait for blood; Let's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;"
20001012,20,1,12,"Let's swallow them up alive like Sheol, And whole, like those who go down into the pit."
20001013,20,1,13,We'll find all valuable wealth. We'll fill our houses with spoil.
20001014,20,1,14,"You shall cast your lot among us. We'll all have one purse."""
20001015,20,1,15,"My son, don't walk in the way with them. Keep your foot from their path,"
20001016,20,1,16,For their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood.
20001017,20,1,17,For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:
20001018,20,1,18,But these lay wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.
20001019,20,1,19,So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. It takes away the life of its owners.
20001020,20,1,20,Wisdom calls aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the public squares.
20001021,20,1,21,"She calls at the head of noisy places. At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:"
20001022,20,1,22,"""How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, And fools hate knowledge?"
20001023,20,1,23,"Turn at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make known my words to you."
20001024,20,1,24,"Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;"
20001025,20,1,25,"But you have ignored all my counsel, And wanted none of my reproof;"
20001026,20,1,26,I also will laugh at your disaster. I will mock when calamity overtakes you;
20001027,20,1,27,"When calamity overtakes you like a storm, When your disaster comes on like a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come on you."
20001028,20,1,28,"Then will they call on me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;"
20001029,20,1,29,"Because they hated knowledge, And didn't choose the fear of Yahweh."
20001030,20,1,30,They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.
20001031,20,1,31,"Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own schemes."
20001032,20,1,32,For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. The careless ease of fools will destroy them.
20001033,20,1,33,"But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, And will be at ease, without fear of harm."""
20002001,20,2,1,"My son, if you will receive my words, And store up my commandments within you;"
20002002,20,2,2,"So as to turn your ear to wisdom, And apply your heart to understanding;"
20002003,20,2,3,"Yes, if you call out for discernment, And lift up your voice for understanding;"
20002004,20,2,4,"If you seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures:"
20002005,20,2,5,"Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, And find the knowledge of God."
20002006,20,2,6,For Yahweh gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
20002007,20,2,7,He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;
20002008,20,2,8,"That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints."
20002009,20,2,9,"Then you will understand righteousness and justice, Equity and every good path."
20002010,20,2,10,For wisdom will enter into your heart. Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
20002011,20,2,11,"Discretion will watch over you. Understanding will keep you,"
20002012,20,2,12,"To deliver you from the way of evil, From the men who speak perverse things;"
20002013,20,2,13,"Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;"
20002014,20,2,14,"Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;"
20002015,20,2,15,"Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:"
20002016,20,2,16,"To deliver you from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;"
20002017,20,2,17,"Who forsakes the friend of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God:"
20002018,20,2,18,"For her house leads down to death, Her paths to the dead."
20002019,20,2,19,"None who go to her return again, Neither do they attain to the paths of life:"
20002020,20,2,20,"That you may walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous."
20002021,20,2,21,For the upright will dwell in the land. The perfect will remain in it.
20002022,20,2,22,But the wicked will be cut off from the land. The treacherous will be rooted out of it.
20003001,20,3,1,"My son, don't forget my teaching; But let your heart keep my commandments:"
20003002,20,3,2,"For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to you."
20003003,20,3,3,Don't let kindness and truth forsake you. Bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart.
20003004,20,3,4,"So you will find favor, And good understanding in the sight of God and man."
20003005,20,3,5,"Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, And don't lean on your own understanding."
20003006,20,3,6,"In all your ways acknowledge him, And he will direct your paths."
20003007,20,3,7,"Don't be wise in your own eyes. Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil."
20003008,20,3,8,"It will be health to your body, And nourishment to your bones."
20003009,20,3,9,"Honor Yahweh with your substance, With the first fruits of all your increase:"
20003010,20,3,10,"So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine."
20003011,20,3,11,"My son, don't despise Yahweh's discipline, Neither be weary of his reproof:"
20003012,20,3,12,"For whom Yahweh loves, he reproves; Even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights."
20003013,20,3,13,"Happy is the man who finds wisdom, The man who gets understanding."
20003014,20,3,14,"For her good profit is better than getting silver, And her return is better than fine gold."
20003015,20,3,15,She is more precious than rubies. None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.
20003016,20,3,16,Length of days is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and honor.
20003017,20,3,17,Her ways are ways of pleasantness. All her paths are peace.
20003018,20,3,18,She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. Happy is everyone who retains her.
20003019,20,3,19,"By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. By understanding, he established the heavens."
20003020,20,3,20,"By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew."
20003021,20,3,21,"My son, let them not depart from your eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion:"
20003022,20,3,22,"So they will be life to your soul, And grace for your neck."
20003023,20,3,23,Then you shall walk in your way securely. Your foot won't stumble.
20003024,20,3,24,"When you lie down, you will not be afraid. Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet."
20003025,20,3,25,"Don't be afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:"
20003026,20,3,26,"For Yahweh will be your confidence, And will keep your foot from being taken."
20003027,20,3,27,"Don't withhold good from those to whom it is due, When it is in the power of your hand to do it."
20003028,20,3,28,"Don't say to your neighbor, ""Go, and come again, Tomorrow I will give it to you,"" When you have it by you."
20003029,20,3,29,"Don't devise evil against your neighbor, Seeing he dwells securely by you."
20003030,20,3,30,"Don't strive with a man without cause, If he has done you no harm."
20003031,20,3,31,Don't envy the man of violence. Choose none of his ways.
20003032,20,3,32,"For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, But his friendship is with the upright."
20003033,20,3,33,"Yahweh's curse is in the house of the wicked, But he blesses the habitation of the righteous."
20003034,20,3,34,"Surely he mocks the mockers, But he gives grace to the humble."
20003035,20,3,35,"The wise will inherit glory, But shame will be the promotion of fools."
20004001,20,4,1,"Listen, sons, to a father's instruction. Pay attention and know understanding;"
20004002,20,4,2,For I give you sound learning. Don't forsake my law.
20004003,20,4,3,"For I was a son to my father, Tender and an only child in the sight of my mother."
20004004,20,4,4,"He taught me, and said to me: ""Let your heart retain my words. Keep my commandments, and live."
20004005,20,4,5,"Get wisdom. Get understanding. Don't forget, neither swerve from the words of my mouth."
20004006,20,4,6,"Don't forsake her, and she will preserve you. Love her, and she will keep you."
20004007,20,4,7,"Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom. Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding."
20004008,20,4,8,"Esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her."
20004009,20,4,9,"She will give to your head a garland of grace. She will deliver a crown of splendor to you."""
20004010,20,4,10,"Listen, my son, and receive my sayings. The years of your life will be many."
20004011,20,4,11,I have taught you in the way of wisdom. I have led you in straight paths.
20004012,20,4,12,"When you go, your steps will not be hampered. When you run, you will not stumble."
20004013,20,4,13,"Take firm hold of instruction. Don't let her go. Keep her, for she is your life."
20004014,20,4,14,Don't enter into the path of the wicked. Don't walk in the way of evil men.
20004015,20,4,15,"Avoid it, and don't pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on."
20004016,20,4,16,"For they don't sleep, unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall."
20004017,20,4,17,"For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence."
20004018,20,4,18,"But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light, That shines more and more until the perfect day."
20004019,20,4,19,The way of the wicked is like darkness. They don't know what they stumble over.
20004020,20,4,20,"My son, attend to my words. Turn your ear to my sayings."
20004021,20,4,21,Let them not depart from your eyes. Keep them in the midst of your heart.
20004022,20,4,22,"For they are life to those who find them, And health to their whole body."
20004023,20,4,23,"Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it is the wellspring of life."
20004024,20,4,24,Put away from yourself a perverse mouth. Put corrupt lips far from you.
20004025,20,4,25,Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you.
20004026,20,4,26,Make the path of your feet level. Let all of your ways be established.
20004027,20,4,27,Don't turn to the right hand nor to the left. Remove your foot from evil.
20005001,20,5,1,"My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Turn your ear to my understanding:"
20005002,20,5,2,"That you may maintain discretion, That your lips may preserve knowledge."
20005003,20,5,3,"For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. Her mouth is smoother than oil,"
20005004,20,5,4,"But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, And as sharp as a two-edged sword."
20005005,20,5,5,Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to Sheol.
20005006,20,5,6,"She gives no thought to the way of life. Her ways are crooked, and she doesn't know it."
20005007,20,5,7,"Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. Don't depart from the words of my mouth."
20005008,20,5,8,"Remove your way far from her. Don't come near the door of her house,"
20005009,20,5,9,"Lest you give your honor to others, And your years to the cruel one;"
20005010,20,5,10,"Lest strangers feast on your wealth, And your labors enrich another man's house."
20005011,20,5,11,"You will groan at your latter end, When your flesh and your body are consumed,"
20005012,20,5,12,"And say, ""How I have hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;"
20005013,20,5,13,"Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!"
20005014,20,5,14,"I have come to the brink of utter ruin, In the midst of the gathered assembly."""
20005015,20,5,15,"Drink water out of your own cistern, Running water out of your own well."
20005016,20,5,16,"Should your springs overflow in the streets, Streams of water in the public squares?"
20005017,20,5,17,"Let them be for yourself alone, Not for strangers with you."
20005018,20,5,18,Let your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
20005019,20,5,19,A loving doe and a graceful deer-- Let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Be captivated always with her love.
20005020,20,5,20,"For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another?"
20005021,20,5,21,For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh. He examines all his paths.
20005022,20,5,22,The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. The cords of his sin hold him firmly.
20005023,20,5,23,"He will die for lack of instruction. In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray."
20006001,20,6,1,"My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, If you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;"
20006002,20,6,2,You are trapped by the words of your mouth. You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.
20006003,20,6,3,"Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, Seeing you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor."
20006004,20,6,4,"Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids."
20006005,20,6,5,"Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, Like a bird from the snare of the fowler."
20006006,20,6,6,"Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise;"
20006007,20,6,7,"Which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,"
20006008,20,6,8,"Provides her bread in the summer, And gathers her food in the harvest."
20006009,20,6,9,"How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?"
20006010,20,6,10,"A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:"
20006011,20,6,11,"So your poverty will come as a robber, And your scarcity as an armed man."
20006012,20,6,12,"A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he who walks with a perverse mouth;"
20006013,20,6,13,"Who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, Who motions with his fingers;"
20006014,20,6,14,"In whose heart is perverseness, Who devises evil continually, Who always sows discord."
20006015,20,6,15,"Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy."
20006016,20,6,16,"There are six things which Yahweh hates; Yes, seven which are an abomination to him:"
20006017,20,6,17,"Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood;"
20006018,20,6,18,"A heart that devises wicked schemes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,"
20006019,20,6,19,"A false witness who utters lies, And he who sows discord among brothers."
20006020,20,6,20,"My son, keep your father's commandment, And don't forsake your mother's teaching."
20006021,20,6,21,Bind them continually on your heart. Tie them around your neck.
20006022,20,6,22,"When you walk, it will lead you. When you sleep, it will watch over you. When you awake, it will talk with you."
20006023,20,6,23,"For the commandment is a lamp, And the law is light. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,"
20006024,20,6,24,"To keep you from the immoral woman, From the flattery of the wayward wife's tongue."
20006025,20,6,25,"Don't lust after her beauty in your heart, Neither let her captivate you with her eyelids."
20006026,20,6,26,For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life.
20006027,20,6,27,"Can a man scoop fire into his lap, And his clothes not be burned?"
20006028,20,6,28,"Or can one walk on hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?"
20006029,20,6,29,So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.
20006030,20,6,30,"Men don't despise a thief, If he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry:"
20006031,20,6,31,"But if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the wealth of his house."
20006032,20,6,32,He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul.
20006033,20,6,33,He will get wounds and dishonor. His reproach will not be wiped away.
20006034,20,6,34,For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. He won't spare in the day of vengeance.
20006035,20,6,35,"He won't regard any ransom, Neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts."
20007001,20,7,1,"My son, keep my words. Lay up my commandments within you."
20007002,20,7,2,Keep my commandments and live; Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.
20007003,20,7,3,Bind them on your fingers. Write them on the tablet of your heart.
20007004,20,7,4,"Tell wisdom, ""You are my sister."" Call understanding your relative,"
20007005,20,7,5,"That they may keep you from the strange woman, From the foreigner who flatters with her words."
20007006,20,7,6,"For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice."
20007007,20,7,7,"I saw among the simple ones. I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,"
20007008,20,7,8,"Passing through the street near her corner, He went the way to her house,"
20007009,20,7,9,"In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness."
20007010,20,7,10,"Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute, And with crafty intent."
20007011,20,7,11,She is loud and defiant. Her feet don't stay in her house.
20007012,20,7,12,"Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, And lurking at every corner."
20007013,20,7,13,"So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him:"
20007014,20,7,14,"""Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me. This day I have paid my vows."
20007015,20,7,15,"Therefore I came out to meet you, To diligently seek your face, And I have found you."
20007016,20,7,16,"I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt."
20007017,20,7,17,"I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon."
20007018,20,7,18,"Come, let's take our fill of loving until the morning. Let's solace ourselves with loving."
20007019,20,7,19,For my husband isn't at home. He has gone on a long journey.
20007020,20,7,20,"He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon."""
20007021,20,7,21,"With persuasive words, she led him astray. With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him."
20007022,20,7,22,"He followed her immediately, As an ox goes to the slaughter, As a fool stepping into a noose."
20007023,20,7,23,"Until an arrow strikes through his liver, As a bird hurries to the snare, And doesn't know that it will cost his life."
20007024,20,7,24,"Now therefore, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to the words of my mouth."
20007025,20,7,25,"Don't let your heart turn to her ways. Don't go astray in her paths,"
20007026,20,7,26,"For she has thrown down many wounded. Yes, all her slain are a mighty host."
20007027,20,7,27,"Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death."
20008001,20,8,1,Doesn't wisdom cry out? Doesn't understanding raise her voice?
20008002,20,8,2,"On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she stands."
20008003,20,8,3,"Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the entry doors, she cries aloud:"
20008004,20,8,4,"""To you men, I call! I send my voice to the sons of mankind."
20008005,20,8,5,"You simple, understand prudence. You fools, be of an understanding heart."
20008006,20,8,6,"Hear, for I will speak excellent things. The opening of my lips is for right things."
20008007,20,8,7,For my mouth speaks truth. Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
20008008,20,8,8,All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
20008009,20,8,9,"They are all plain to him who understands, Right to those who find knowledge."
20008010,20,8,10,Receive my instruction rather than silver; Knowledge rather than choice gold.

20022009,20,22,9,He who has a generous eye will be blessed; For he shares his food with the poor.
20022010,20,22,10,"Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out; Yes, quarrels and insults will stop."
20022011,20,22,11,He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully Is the king's friend.
20022012,20,22,12,The eyes of Yahweh watch over knowledge; But he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.
20022013,20,22,13,"The sluggard says, ""There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the streets!"""
20022014,20,22,14,The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit: He who is under Yahweh's wrath will fall into it.
20022015,20,22,15,Folly is bound up in the heart of a child: The rod of discipline drives it far from him.
20022016,20,22,16,"Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich, Both come to poverty."
20022017,20,22,17,"Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise. Apply your heart to my teaching."
20022018,20,22,18,"For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you, If all of them are ready on your lips."
20022019,20,22,19,"That your trust may be in Yahweh, I teach you today, even you."
20022020,20,22,20,"Haven't I written to you thirty excellent things Of counsel and knowledge,"
20022021,20,22,21,"To teach you truth, reliable words, To give sound answers to the ones who sent you?"
20022022,20,22,22,"Don't exploit the poor, because he is poor; And don't crush the needy in court;"
20022023,20,22,23,"For Yahweh will plead their case, And plunder the life of those who plunder them."
20022024,20,22,24,"Don't befriend a hot-tempered man, And don't associate with one who harbors anger:"
20022025,20,22,25,"Lest you learn his ways, And ensnare your soul."
20022026,20,22,26,"Don't you be one of those who strike hands, Of those who are collateral for debts."
20022027,20,22,27,"If you don't have means to pay, Why should he take away your bed from under you?"
20022028,20,22,28,"Don't move the ancient boundary stone, Which your fathers have set up."
20022029,20,22,29,Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve kings; He won't serve obscure men.
20023001,20,23,1,"When you sit to eat with a ruler, Consider diligently what is before you;"
20023002,20,23,2,"Put a knife to your throat, If you are a man given to appetite."
20023003,20,23,3,"Don't be desirous of his dainties, Seeing they are deceitful food."
20023004,20,23,4,"Don't weary yourself to be rich. In your wisdom, show restraint."
20023005,20,23,5,Why do you set your eyes on that which is not? For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.
20023006,20,23,6,"Don't eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, And don't crave his delicacies:"
20023007,20,23,7,"For as he thinks about the cost, so he is. ""Eat and drink!"" he says to you, But his heart is not with you."
20023008,20,23,8,"The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up, And lose your good words."
20023009,20,23,9,"Don't speak in the ears of a fool, For he will despise the wisdom of your words."
20023010,20,23,10,Don't move the ancient boundary stone. Don't encroach on the fields of the fatherless:
20023011,20,23,11,For their Defender is strong. He will plead their case against you.
20023012,20,23,12,"Apply your heart to instruction, And your ears to the words of knowledge."
20023013,20,23,13,"Don't withhold correction from a child. If you punish him with the rod, he will not die."
20023014,20,23,14,"Punish him with the rod, And save his soul from Sheol."
20023015,20,23,15,"My son, if your heart is wise, Then my heart will be glad, even mine:"
20023016,20,23,16,"Yes, my heart will rejoice, When your lips speak what is right."
20023017,20,23,17,Don't let your heart envy sinners; But rather fear Yahweh all the day long.
20023018,20,23,18,"Indeed surely there is a future hope, And your hope will not be cut off."
20023019,20,23,19,"Listen, my son, and be wise, And keep your heart on the right path!"
20023020,20,23,20,"Don't be among ones drinking too much wine, Or those who gorge themselves on meat:"
20023021,20,23,21,For the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor; And drowsiness clothes them in rags.
20023022,20,23,22,"Listen to your father who gave you life, And don't despise your mother when she is old."
20023023,20,23,23,"Buy the truth, and don't sell it: Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding."
20023024,20,23,24,The father of the righteous has great joy. Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.
20023025,20,23,25,Let your father and your mother be glad! Let her who bore you rejoice!
20023026,20,23,26,"My son, give me your heart; And let your eyes keep in my ways."
20023027,20,23,27,For a prostitute is a deep pit; And a wayward wife is a narrow well.
20023028,20,23,28,"Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, And increases the unfaithful among men."
20023029,20,23,29,Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?
20023030,20,23,30,Those who stay long at the wine; Those who go to seek out mixed wine.
20023031,20,23,31,"Don't look at the wine when it is red, When it sparkles in the cup, When it goes down smoothly:"
20023032,20,23,32,"In the end, it bites like a snake, And poisons like a viper."
20023033,20,23,33,"Your eyes will see strange things, And your mind will imagine confusing things."
20023034,20,23,34,"Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea, Or as he who lies on top of the rigging:"
20023035,20,23,35,"""They hit me, and I was not hurt; They beat me, and I don't feel it! When will I wake up? I can do it again. I can find another."""
20024001,20,24,1,Don't be envious of evil men; Neither desire to be with them:
20024002,20,24,2,"For their hearts plot violence, And their lips talk about mischief."
20024003,20,24,3,Through wisdom a house is built; By understanding it is established;
20024004,20,24,4,By knowledge the rooms are filled With all rare and beautiful treasure.
20024005,20,24,5,A wise man has great power; And a knowledgeable man increases strength;
20024006,20,24,6,For by wise guidance you wage your war; And victory is in many advisors.
20024007,20,24,7,Wisdom is too high for a fool: He doesn't open his mouth in the gate.
20024008,20,24,8,One who plots to do evil Will be called a schemer.
20024009,20,24,9,The schemes of folly are sin. The mocker is detested by men.
20024010,20,24,10,"If you falter in the time of trouble, Your strength is small."
20024011,20,24,11,"Rescue those who are being led away to death! Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!"
20024012,20,24,12,"If you say, ""Behold, we didn't know this;"" Doesn't he who weighs the hearts consider it? He who keeps your soul, doesn't he know it? Shall he not render to every man according to his work?"
20024013,20,24,13,"My son, eat honey, for it is good; The droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:"
20024014,20,24,14,"So you shall know wisdom to be to your soul; If you have found it, then there will be a reward, Your hope will not be cut off."
20024015,20,24,15,"Don't lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous. Don't destroy his resting-place:"
20024016,20,24,16,"For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again; But the wicked are overthrown by calamity."
20024017,20,24,17,Don't rejoice when your enemy falls. Don't let your heart be glad when he is overthrown;
20024018,20,24,18,"Lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him, And he turn away his wrath from him."
20024019,20,24,19,Don't fret yourself because of evildoers; Neither be envious of the wicked:
20024020,20,24,20,For there will be no reward to the evil man; And the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out.
20024021,20,24,21,"My son, fear Yahweh and the king. Don't join those who are rebellious:"
20024022,20,24,22,For their calamity will rise suddenly; The destruction from them both--who knows?
20024023,20,24,23,These also are sayings of the wise. To show partiality in judgment is not good.
20024024,20,24,24,"He who says to the wicked, ""You are righteous;"" Peoples shall curse him, and nations shall abhor him--"
20024025,20,24,25,"But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, And a rich blessing will come on them."
20024026,20,24,26,An honest answer Is like a kiss on the lips.
20024027,20,24,27,"Prepare your work outside, And get your fields ready. Afterwards, build your house."
20024028,20,24,28,Don't be a witness against your neighbor without cause. Don't deceive with your lips.
20024029,20,24,29,"Don't say, ""I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work."""
20024030,20,24,30,"I went by the field of the sluggard, By the vineyard of the man void of understanding;"
20024031,20,24,31,"Behold, it was all grown over with thorns. Its surface was covered with nettles, And its stone wall was broken down."
20024032,20,24,32,"Then I saw, and considered well. I saw, and received instruction:"
20024033,20,24,33,"A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep;"
20024034,20,24,34,"So shall your poverty come as a robber, And your want as an armed man."
20025001,20,25,1,"These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out."
20025002,20,25,2,"It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, But the glory of kings is to search out a matter."
20025003,20,25,3,"As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, So the hearts of kings are unsearchable."
20025004,20,25,4,"Take away the dross from the silver, And material comes out for the refiner;"
20025005,20,25,5,"Take away the wicked from the king's presence, And his throne will be established in righteousness."
20025006,20,25,6,"Don't exalt yourself in the presence of the king, Or claim a place among great men;"
20025007,20,25,7,"For it is better that it be said to you, ""Come up here,"" Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, Whom your eyes have seen."
20025008,20,25,8,Don't be hasty in bringing charges to court. What will you do in the end when your neighbor shames you?
20025009,20,25,9,"Debate your case with your neighbor, And don't betray the confidence of another;"
20025010,20,25,10,"Lest one who hears it put you to shame, And your bad reputation never depart."
20025011,20,25,11,A word fitly spoken Is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
20025012,20,25,12,"As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, So is a wise reprover to an obedient ear."
20025013,20,25,13,"As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, So is a faithful messenger to those who send him; For he refreshes the soul of his masters."
20025014,20,25,14,"As clouds and wind without rain, So is he who boasts of gifts deceptively."
20025015,20,25,15,By patience a ruler is persuaded. A soft tongue breaks the bone.
20025016,20,25,16,"Have you found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for you, Lest you eat too much, and vomit it."
20025017,20,25,17,"Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, Lest he be weary of you, and hate you."
20025018,20,25,18,"A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor Is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow."
20025019,20,25,19,"Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble Is like a bad tooth, or a lame foot."
20025020,20,25,20,"As one who takes away a garment in cold weather, Or vinegar on soda, So is one who sings songs to a heavy heart."
20025021,20,25,21,"If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; If he is thirsty, give him water to drink:"
20025022,20,25,22,"For you will heap coals of fire on his head, And Yahweh will reward you."
20025023,20,25,23,The north wind brings forth rain: So a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.
20025024,20,25,24,"It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than to share a house with a contentious woman."
20025025,20,25,25,"Like cold water to a thirsty soul, So is good news from a far country."
20025026,20,25,26,"Like a muddied spring, and a polluted well, So is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked."
20025027,20,25,27,It is not good to eat much honey; Nor is it honorable to seek one's own honor.
20025028,20,25,28,Like a city that is broken down and without walls Is a man whose spirit is without restraint.
20026001,20,26,1,"Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honor is not fitting for a fool."
20026002,20,26,2,"Like a fluttering sparrow, Like a darting swallow, So the undeserved curse doesn't come to rest."
20026003,20,26,3,"A whip for the horse, A bridle for the donkey, And a rod for the back of fools!"
20026004,20,26,4,"Don't answer a fool according to his folly, Lest you also be like him."
20026005,20,26,5,"Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes."
20026006,20,26,6,One who sends a message by the hand of a fool Is cutting off feet and drinking violence.
20026007,20,26,7,Like the legs of the lame that hang loose: So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
20026008,20,26,8,"As one who binds a stone in a sling, So is he who gives honor to a fool."
20026009,20,26,9,"Like a thornbush that goes into the hand of a drunkard, So is a parable in the mouth of fools."
20026010,20,26,10,"As an archer who wounds all, So is he who hires a fool Or he who hires those who pass by."
20026011,20,26,11,"As a dog that returns to his vomit, So is a fool who repeats his folly."
20026012,20,26,12,Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
20026013,20,26,13,"The sluggard says, ""There is a lion in the road! A fierce lion roams the streets!"""
20026014,20,26,14,"As the door turns on its hinges, So does the sluggard on his bed."
20026015,20,26,15,The sluggard buries his hand in the dish. He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
20026016,20,26,16,The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes Than seven men who answer with discretion.
20026017,20,26,17,Like one who grabs a dog's ears Is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.
20026018,20,26,18,"Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death,"
20026019,20,26,19,"Is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, ""Am I not joking?"""
20026020,20,26,20,"For lack of wood a fire goes out; Without gossip, a quarrel dies down."
20026021,20,26,21,"As coals are to hot embers, And wood to fire, So is a contentious man to kindling strife."
20026022,20,26,22,"The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, They go down into the innermost parts."
20026023,20,26,23,Like silver dross on an earthen vessel Are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.
20026024,20,26,24,"A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, But he harbors evil in his heart."
20026025,20,26,25,"When his speech is charming, don't believe him; For there are seven abominations in his heart:"
20026026,20,26,26,"His malice may be concealed by deception, But his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly."
20026027,20,26,27,"Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it. Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him."
20026028,20,26,28,A lying tongue hates those it hurts; And a flattering mouth works ruin.
20027001,20,27,1,Don't boast about tomorrow; For you don't know what a day may bring forth.
20027002,20,27,2,"Let another man praise you, And not your own mouth; A stranger, and not your own lips."
20027003,20,27,3,"A stone is heavy, And sand is a burden; But a fool's provocation is heavier than both."
20027004,20,27,4,"Wrath is cruel, And anger is overwhelming; But who is able to stand before jealousy?"
20027005,20,27,5,Better is open rebuke Than hidden love.
20027006,20,27,6,Faithful are the wounds of a friend; Although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
20027007,20,27,7,"A full soul loathes a honeycomb; But to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet."
20027008,20,27,8,"As a bird that wanders from her nest, So is a man who wanders from his home."
20027009,20,27,9,Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; So does earnest counsel from a man's friend.
20027010,20,27,10,Don't forsake your friend and your father's friend. Don't go to your brother's house in the day of your disaster: Better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother.
20027011,20,27,11,"Be wise, my son, And bring joy to my heart, Then I can answer my tormentor."
20027012,20,27,12,"A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; But the simple pass on, and suffer for it:"
20027013,20,27,13,Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger; Hold it for a wayward woman!
20027014,20,27,14,"He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, It will be taken as a curse by him."
20027015,20,27,15,A continual dropping on a rainy day And a contentious wife are alike:
20027016,20,27,16,"Restraining her is like restraining the wind, Or like grasping oil in his right hand."
20027017,20,27,17,Iron sharpens iron; So a man sharpens his friend's countenance.
20027018,20,27,18,Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit. He who looks after his master shall be honored.
20027019,20,27,19,"As water reflects a face, So a man's heart reflects the man."
20027020,20,27,20,Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; And a man's eyes are never satisfied.
20027021,20,27,21,"The crucible is for silver, And the furnace for gold; But man is refined by his praise."
20027022,20,27,22,"Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, Yet his foolishness will not be removed from him."
20027023,20,27,23,"Know well the state of your flocks, And pay attention to your herds:"
20027024,20,27,24,"For riches are not forever, Nor does even the crown endure to all generations."
20027025,20,27,25,"The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, The grasses of the hills are gathered in."
20027026,20,27,26,"The lambs are for your clothing, And the goats are the price of a field."
20027027,20,27,27,"There will be plenty of goats' milk for your food, For your family's food, And for the nourishment of your servant girls."
20028001,20,28,1,The wicked flee when no one pursues; But the righteous are as bold as a lion.
20028002,20,28,2,"In rebellion, a land has many rulers, But order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge."
20028003,20,28,3,A needy man who oppresses the poor Is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.
20028004,20,28,4,Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; But those who keep the law contend with them.
20028005,20,28,5,Evil men don't understand justice; But those who seek Yahweh understand it fully.
20028006,20,28,6,"Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, Than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich."
20028007,20,28,7,Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; But he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.
20028008,20,28,8,He who increases his wealth by excessive interest Gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.
20028009,20,28,9,"He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination."
20028010,20,28,10,"Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, He will fall into his own trap; But the blameless will inherit good."
20028011,20,28,11,The rich man is wise in his own eyes; But the poor who has understanding sees through him.
20028012,20,28,12,"When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves."
20028013,20,28,13,"He who conceals his sins doesn't prosper, But whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy."
20028014,20,28,14,Blessed is the man who always fears; But one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.
20028015,20,28,15,"As a roaring lion or a charging bear, So is a wicked ruler over helpless people."
20028016,20,28,16,A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment. One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.
20028017,20,28,17,A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death; No one will support him.
20028018,20,28,18,Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; But one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.
20028019,20,28,19,One who works his land will have an abundance of food; But one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
20028020,20,28,20,A faithful man is rich with blessings; But one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.
20028021,20,28,21,To show partiality is not good; Yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.
20028022,20,28,22,"A stingy man hurries after riches, And doesn't know that poverty waits for him."
20028023,20,28,23,One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor Than one who flatters with the tongue.
