2016013,2,16,13,It happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.
2016014,2,16,14,"When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the hoar-frost on the ground."
2016015,2,16,15,"When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, ""What is it?"" For they didn't know what it was. Moses said to them, ""It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat."""

2016018,2,16,18,"When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered every man according to his eating."
2016019,2,16,19,"Moses said to them, ""Let no one leave of it until the morning."""
2016020,2,16,20,"Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them."
2016021,2,16,21,"They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted."
2016022,2,16,22,"It happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses."
2016023,2,16,23,"He said to them, ""This is that which Yahweh has spoken, 'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning."""

2016030,2,16,30,So the people rested on the seventh day.
2016031,2,16,31,"The house of Israel called the name of it Manna,{""Mana"" means ""What is it?""} and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey."

2017001,2,17,1,"All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to Yahweh's commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink."

2017012,2,17,12,"But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset."
2017013,2,17,13,Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

2038031,2,38,31,"the sockets around the court, the sockets of the gate of the court, all the pins of the tent, and all the pins around the court."
2039001,2,39,1,"Of the blue, purple, and scarlet, they made finely worked garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2039002,2,39,2,"He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen."
2039003,2,39,3,"They beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, in the purple, in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skillful workman."
2039004,2,39,4,"They made shoulder-pieces for it, joined together. At the two ends it was joined together."
2039005,2,39,5,"The skillfully woven band that was on it, with which to fasten it on, was of the same piece, like its work; of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen; as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2039006,2,39,6,"They worked the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold, engraved with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel."
2039007,2,39,7,"He put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2039008,2,39,8,"He made the breastplate, the work of a skillful workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen."
2039009,2,39,9,"It was square. They made the breastplate double. Its length was a span, and its breadth a span, being double."
2039010,2,39,10,"They set in it four rows of stones. A row of ruby, topaz, and beryl was the first row;"
2039011,2,39,11,"and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire{or, lapis lazuli}, and an emerald;"
2039012,2,39,12,"and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;"
2039013,2,39,13,"and the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in gold settings."
2039014,2,39,14,"The stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, everyone according to his name, for the twelve tribes."
2039015,2,39,15,"They made on the breastplate chains like cords, of braided work of pure gold."
2039016,2,39,16,"They made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate."
2039017,2,39,17,They put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.
2039018,2,39,18,"The other two ends of the two braided chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the front of it."
2039019,2,39,19,"They made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge of it, which was toward the side of the ephod inward."
2039020,2,39,20,"They made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the front of it, close by its coupling, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod."
2039021,2,39,21,"They bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not come loose from the ephod, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2039022,2,39,22,"He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue."
2039023,2,39,23,"The opening of the robe in the midst of it was like the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding around its opening, that it should not be torn."
2039024,2,39,24,"They made on the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet, and twined linen."
2039025,2,39,25,"They made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates around the skirts of the robe, between the pomegranates;"
2039026,2,39,26,"a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the skirts of the robe, to minister in, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2039027,2,39,27,"They made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,"
2039028,2,39,28,"and the turban of fine linen, and the linen headbands of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,"
2039029,2,39,29,"and the sash of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2039030,2,39,30,"They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it a writing, like the engravings of a signet: ""HOLY TO YAHWEH."""
2039031,2,39,31,"They tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2039032,2,39,32,Thus all the work of the tent of the tent of meeting was finished. The children of Israel did according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses; so they did.
2039033,2,39,33,"They brought the tent to Moses, the tent, with all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, it bars, its pillars, its sockets,"
2039034,2,39,34,"the covering of rams' skins dyed red, the covering of sea cow hides, the veil of the screen,"
2039035,2,39,35,"the ark of the testimony with its poles, the mercy seat,"
2039036,2,39,36,"the table, all its vessels, the show bread,"

2039041,2,39,41,"the finely worked garments for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office."
2039042,2,39,42,"According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work."
2039043,2,39,43,"Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it as Yahweh had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them."
2040001,2,40,1,"Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,"
2040002,2,40,2,"""On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tent of the Tent of Meeting."
2040003,2,40,3,"You shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and you shall screen the ark with the veil."
2040004,2,40,4,"You shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are on it. You shall bring in the lampstand, and light the lamps of it."
2040005,2,40,5,"You shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tent."
2040006,2,40,6,You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tent of the tent of meeting.
2040007,2,40,7,"You shall set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein."
2040008,2,40,8,"You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court."
2040009,2,40,9,"You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tent, and all that is in it, and shall make it holy, and all its furniture: and it will be holy."
2040010,2,40,10,"You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar will be most holy."
2040011,2,40,11,"You shall anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it."
2040012,2,40,12,"You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water."
2040013,2,40,13,"You shall put on Aaron the holy garments; and you shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office."
2040014,2,40,14,"You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them."
2040015,2,40,15,"You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office. Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations."
2040016,2,40,16,"Thus did Moses: according to all that Yahweh commanded him, so he did."
2040017,2,40,17,"It happened in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tent was raised up."
2040018,2,40,18,"Moses raised up the tent, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards of it, and put in the bars of it, and raised up its pillars."
2040019,2,40,19,"He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tent above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2040020,2,40,20,"He took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark."
2040021,2,40,21,"He brought the ark into the tent, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2040022,2,40,22,"He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the side of the tent northward, outside of the veil."
2040023,2,40,23,"He set the bread in order on it before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2040024,2,40,24,"He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tent southward."
2040025,2,40,25,"He lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2040026,2,40,26,He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil;
2040027,2,40,27,"and he burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2040028,2,40,28,He put up the screen of the door to the tent.
2040029,2,40,29,"He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tent of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal-offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2040030,2,40,30,"He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash."
2040031,2,40,31,"Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there."
2040032,2,40,32,"When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses."
2040033,2,40,33,"He raised up the court around the tent and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work."
2040034,2,40,34,"Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tent."
2040035,2,40,35,"Moses wasn't able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh's glory filled the tent."
2040036,2,40,36,"When the cloud was taken up from over the tent, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys;"
2040037,2,40,37,"but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel until the day that it was taken up."
2040038,2,40,38,"For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tent by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys."
